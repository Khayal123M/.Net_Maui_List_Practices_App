C# , XAML , .NET MAUI-Cross Mobil Platform

My sample project in .NET MAUI creates a list and provides functionality to add elements to the list using a button, search within the list, delete selected items from the list, and update the information of selected items. Additionally, at the bottom of the page, the number of elements in the list is displayed to the user. The XAML code contains a table where the user can view the list items. In the C# section, the LINQ library is used to perform operations on the list items.

What is .Net MAUI ?

.NET MAUI allows developers to create a single codebase and user interface (UI) definition while targeting multiple platforms. This means you can write your application logic once and have it run on different devices and platforms without significant modifications. It provides a unified API surface, allowing developers to access platform-specific features and capabilities when needed.

With .NET MAUI, you can use C# and XAML to build native user interfaces that are optimized for each platform. It offers a rich set of UI controls and layouts, along with powerful data binding capabilities and support for MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern.

What is LINQ library ?

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a feature in C# that provides a powerful and expressive way to query and manipulate data from different data sources. It is a part of the .NET Framework and is available in various versions of C#, including C# 3.0 and later.

LINQ allows developers to write queries directly within the C# programming language, making it easier to work with collections, databases, XML, and other data sources. It provides a unified syntax and set of operators to perform common data operations such as filtering, sorting, grouping, joining, and aggregating.

LINQ queries are written using a combination of query expressions and lambda expressions. Query expressions resemble SQL-like syntax and allow you to express your intentions in a declarative manner. Lambda expressions, on the other hand, provide a concise syntax for defining inline functions or predicates.
